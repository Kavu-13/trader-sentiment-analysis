# Trader Behavior vs. Market Sentiment Analysis

## Junior Data Scientist Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Data Science Assignment. The objective of this project is to explore the relationship between trader performance (profitability, volume) and overall market sentiment (Fear vs. Greed), with the goal of uncovering hidden patterns that could lead to smarter trading strategies.
